# Summary of this repository

During my engineering studes I followed the [Machine Learning](https://github.com/wikistat/Apprentissage), the [High Dimensional & Deep Learning](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning) as well as [Artificial Intelligence Frameworks] courses over two years.
 In theses courses, I acquired knowledge in machine and deep learning algoritms and their application on various type of data. This knowledge is primordial to become a DataScientist. 

This course has three main objectives. You will
