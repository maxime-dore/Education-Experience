# Summary of this repository

During my engineering studes I followed the [Machine Learning](https://github.com/wikistat/Apprentissage), the [High Dimensional & Deep Learning](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning) as well as [Artificial Intelligence Frameworks](https://github.com/wikistat/AI-Frameworks) courses over two years.
 In theses courses, I acquired knowledge in machine and deep learning algorithms and their application on various type of data. This knowledge is primordial to become a DataScientist, the practical works done during these year of studies can be found on the following github repository.

 ## Technical requirements. 
 
 All the libraries required to execute the notebooks are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 
 
 Thus, it is recommended to build a new functional environment. To do so, execute the following lines:
 
 ```
conda create -n AIF python=3.8
conda activate AIF
pip install -r requirements.txtÂ 
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.12.0
```
