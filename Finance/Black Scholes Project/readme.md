The use of options, as well as other derivatives, has increased sharply over the last decades, becoming a key financial instrument on financial
markets. If the well-known Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model has brought a consistent framework for the pricing of financial options, its discrete
time structure leads to substantial limitations, specifically when it comes to study the continuity and the dynamics of the derived pricing of
the options. Thus, there is a need to develop an extension of that model, continuous in time, which still guarantees the fairness of pricing on
financial markets. Our study aims to introduce several mathematical concepts which support the construction of such a theoretical model
for the arbitrage pricing of options. To do so, we have studied in detail and implemented various fundamental properties from the stochastic
calculus theory, especially inherited from It√¥. Then, applying properly these stochastic calculus results to the specific stochastic process
of the Bownian motion, we have derived the rigorous framework of the Black-Scholes model. This crucial model of financial mathematics
allows to derive an arbitrage pricing and hedging process, especially for options, in a continuous-time basis. Our theoretical findings are
illustrated through several numerical simulations and computations.
