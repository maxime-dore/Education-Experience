# Use of Hawkes processes in a Cramer-Lundberg type model

This project aims to implement Hawkes processes in Python, then to study their selfexciting
properties. In order to study this process in a realistic way, we decided to set a
particular context.
The main model presented in this analysis to simulate the risk process associated to the insurance
company is the Cramer-Lundberg model. The goal is to present the different results,
depending on the claims and the parameters that may have the self-exciting process, to our
fictive insurance company team.
The first part of this record is a study of the Hawkes processes, to do so we first recalled point
process properties. We decided to use the simulation of an homogeneous Poisson process
to implement display programs in order to reuse it in the Hawkes simulation part. Afterwards
we simulate Hawkes processes and analyse its parameters and properties. In a second
part, we recalled the Cramer-Lundberg model and tried to fit in the Hawkes process. The
final part consists of a comeback to the realistic context. We will present the results to the
company and describe how Hawkes processes could be useful to us. We will also discuss the
choices and results we obtained.
