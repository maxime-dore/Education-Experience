# Stock portfolio optimization subject to risk constraints with simple management
<br>
<br>

Any individual can invest capital in the financial markets, many people are afraid to do so
because of their ignorance of the markets. While everybody wants to invest his capital optimally,
a portfolio can be managed in many different ways as its structure, composed of financial assets,
is very unpredictable since it relies on financial markets. Our goal is to study the fundamental
aspects of portfolio management by presenting different notions of risk and expected return, so
that an individual can understand the basics notions of a portfolio through a simple problem.
To do so, we define the notion of portfolio and we apply optimization methods with constraints
to our problem in order to find the best strategy. These solutions have allowed us to determine
the portfolio that has the best expected return with a given risk and also the one that minimizes
the risk with a given return. Although the randomness of financial markets still frightens people,
this application will be useful for people who want to invest in financial markets and understand
how they should do it. This paper is built on mathematical modeling based on past data, the
next step of this research is to use temporal series to approximate the incoming values of the
stocks and then apply the strategy described in this article.
